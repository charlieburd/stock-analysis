# Module 2 - Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

#### Analyze 12 stocks, defined by their ticker, by looking at their total trade volume and return for 2017 and 2018. Then create a refactored VBA script that will run the analysis in a less time. 


## Results

### Stock Analysis:

#### Of the 12 stocks analyized 2017 saw a much better year for growth, with 11 of the 12 stocks having a positive return. TERP had the worst return of -7.21% and DQ had the best return of 199.45%. In  2018 only 2 of the 12 stocks saw a positive return. DQ has the worst return of -62.60% and RUN has the best return of 83.95%

### VBA Analysis:

#### I was unable to create an improved VBA script that reduced the time to run the macro. I believe I was not able to figure out how to include the Index portion of the module, I wasnt familar with that it was asking and all google searches resulted in using Index as a function. The module could run without error but I did not give me the outputs I wanted. Additionally it took significally longer. Going from 0.45 seconds to run to 23.71 second to run for 2018.
