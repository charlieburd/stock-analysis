# Module 2 - Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

#### Analyze 12 stocks, defined by their ticker, by looking at their total trade volume and return for 2017 and 2018. Then create a refactored VBA script that will run the analysis in a less time. 


## Results

#### Stock Analysis:

#### Of the 12 stocks analyized 2017 saw a much better year for growth, with 11 of the 12 stocks having a positive return. TERP had the worst return of -7.21% and DQ had the best return of 199.45%. In  2018 only 2 of the 12 stocks saw a positive return. DQ has the worst return of -62.60% and RUN has the best return of 83.95%

#### VBA Analysis:

#### I was unable to create an improved VBA script that reduced the time to run the macro. I believe I was not able to figure out how to include the Index portion of the module, I wasnt familar with that it was asking and all google searches resulted in using Index as a function. The module could run without error but I did not give me the outputs I wanted. Additionally it took significally longer. Going from 0.45 seconds to run to 23.71 second to run for 2018.

#### **Pre-refactoring**

## Summary

####Refectoring, if done propertly, can make the scrpit shorter and take less time to run. I beleive it also should allow the code too me However, it does require more effort to get to that point and allow more room for mistakes. In my instance, refactoring rendored the original script useless and it took longer to run. The computer would also freeze for able 1minute each time I tried to test the new code.
